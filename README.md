The project, "Creating Material Management Dashboard Using Tableau," aims to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly dashboard for managing materials within an organization. The dashboard will be built using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to easily create interactive and visually appealing dashboards.


The dashboard can include a variety of visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs to display data related to inventory levels, stock movements, and purchasing patterns.

## Objective of the conducted project are given below 

1.	To assuring a supply of material with optimized inventory levels and minimum deviation between planned and actual results.

2.	To reduced risk. 

3.	To find out different stock values under sales engineer, location and supplier.

4.	To find out customer and responsible engineer wise open order status.

## Sheets include : 

1.Stock List: Materials sector stocks produce the core materials used by other industries. Stock inventory management is extra inventory that is ordered and set aside in case the company doesn't have enough for replenishment. 

 In this stock list include item name or product name such as 676.0016-D, 676.001905-D
72020-3-2025L KONTRA 72525L-M, 10208L Support & KAM2L Clamp (Used) etc. Different manufacturer such as Arno, Duemmel WNT Product, ISCAR, Vandurit etc.

In this company there are two main manufacturers i.e., Arno, Duemmel which helps Prompt tooling to make more profits. Prompt tooling have different godown location such as pune, Aurangabad, Bangalore, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur. There are different sales engineers which are responsible for all type of material management.
 

2.Open Order Status: Open orders are those unfilled and working orders still in the market waiting to be executed. Orders may remain open because certain conditions such as limit price have not yet been met
 
An open order is defined as an order placed by the customer which is under process and is yet to be fulfilled by the supplier.

## The detail of the given data used in the project are as follows:

In this study there are data set which contain near about 244 entries for material management.

With Tableau, users can simply connect to numerous data sources, build interactive dashboards and charts, and share their insights with others. Bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, heat maps, and a host of other visualization options are available.

Before beginning the actual problem-solving process, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of the data in order to prevent confusion in the future. Let's first comprehend the data columns so that we may gain a quick overview.

Data which include stock list, open order status, expense etc.
All above variable are used to creating material management dashboard for finding out some insights.
	
## The format of stock list dataset are as follows:

In this data set there are different variable such as item name, batch, godown location, Qty, rate, amount and last one is make    i.e. supplier


## There are two sheets 
				1.Stock list 
				2.Open order status.


## Conclusion for the given project is  : 


1.	According to my analysis tableau is a revolutionary approach to simplifying the business intelligence and data analytics space, allowing individuals and organisations to easily provide data, built report or have automatically created and add into a new dashboard and share this dashboard them with limited time and efforts. 


2.	Tableau help company to improve material management with more accuracy and less time. Using stock list we can find out how many stock value are there at this movement.


3.	From open order status of company, we can find out the  customer wise and engineer wise total value. With the help of customer PO total price, we can easily visualise the which customer and engineer have responsible for particular product.


4.	Tableau's visualization capabilities allowed for the easy creation of interactive and informative dashboards that effectively display the data related to material management.

5.	Arno and Dummel are the two main suppliers which supply more tools with accurate time and this supplier help to maximize profit.

6.	We can conclude that here Sales engineer Tushar have more responsibility because of their location.
